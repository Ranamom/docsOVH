## Objective

**The purpose of this guide is to provide a procedure for migrating to VMware Cloud Director on OVHcloud.**

## Requirements

- A managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud solution.
- You must have access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager) and be technical administrator of the managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud infrastructure.

## In practice

This practical guide is designed to provide you with information and solutions on the process of migrating your managed VMware vSphere on OVHcloud services to a managed VMware Cloud Director on OVHcloud solution.

It also details the requirements for each use case, and if applicable, explains the requirements for a migration.

| ![VCD Migration Block](images/vcd_migration_block_validation_en.png){thumbnail} | 1. Before migrating, it is important to check the checklist of specific use cases below and follow any associated recommendations.<br/>2. Once you have met these requirements, you can log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel to sign (in the block provided for this purpose) the specific conditions of the environment planned to be migrated (T&C).<br/>3. OVHcloud teams will migrate VMs from the main VMware vSphere on OVHcloud datacentre (vDC) using a hot migration path (vMotion).<br/> |

This hot migration will minimize disruptions to your public or private networks. Private networks are the most likely to be affected, with downtime of the order of a few minutes.

Your virtual machines will remain operational during the migration, with no downtime. However, there is a risk that some network packets will be lost during vMotion.

This migration should be done with no noticeable impact for most applications, but we recommend that you monitor them closely throughout the process.

As a reminder, if you decide to switch to the managed VCD on OVHcloud offer, the new prices will not be applied to your existing servers/hosts. We will cover the increase of licensing prices until the migration is complete.

### Step 1 - Before migration (mandatory)

#### Applications made before 01 November 2024

> [!primary]
>
> You can migrate your current VMware vSphere on OVHcloud environments as soon as you receive your request.
>
> **Important**: The special conditions available since the beginning of November 2024 in the OVHcloud Control Panel must be signed for the migration to be carried out by the OVHcloud teams.
>

Please review the product demo and webinar to familiarize yourself with this new offering.

Migrations will be carried out in 4 waves, from October onwards, depending on the services active in your environment.

The planned schedule, which is compatible with these environments during the migration, is as follows:

| **Waves** |     **Dates**     | **Target Offers** |  **NSX**   |  **vRack**  |  **vSAN**   | **Microsoft (SPLA)<br/>on OVHcloud** | **Summary of migration compatible environments**                                                                                                         |

During this process, your data will remain unchanged, except for vSAN Storage. Your IP addresses will also remain unchanged.

The migration date will be sent to you by email at least 15 days before the start of the migration.

We recommend reading our guide [VMware Cloud Director - The fundamentals of VCDs](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vcd-get-concepts) to see which features are included in each migration wave of your environments.

#### Applications made after 01 November 2024

> [!primary]
>
> Migration requests made after 01 November 2024 have the same requirements as for all other migration requests mentioned in this guide.
>
> You will need to make a request via a [support ticket](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm?id=csm_get_help), which will allow you to have all the information and sign the T&Cs.
>

We will then notify you of the migration date, and set it.

#### Managed Veeam for VCD (mandatory)

**Storage repository configuration**

After the migration, you will need to configure your new **Veeam Data Platform** on managed VCD on OVHcloud storage implementation with the correct settings.

These settings can be customized to suit your chosen service levels:

| **Repository**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  **Target Offers**  | **Comments**                                                                          |

| ü•à `Silver Repository (100 To)`        |     `Advanced`      | - **Standard Object Storage** with off-site backup                                    |
| ü•á `Gold Repository (100 To)`          |      `Premium`      | - **High Performance Object Storage** with off-site backup and 14 immutability points |

All these repositories have a storage quota of **100 To**. You can contact the [support](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm?id=csm_get_help) teams to increase this quota.
