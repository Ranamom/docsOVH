> The interface of the Zimbra application is similar to webmail. For more details on the features and settings, please read our guide on [Using Zimbra webmail](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/mx_plan/email_zimbra) .

### Use the email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive messages.

OVHcloud also offers a web application that can be used to access your email address from a web browser. You can access it via [this link](/links/web/email). You can log in using your email credentials. If you have any questions on how to use it, please read our guide on [Using Zimbra webmail](/pages/web_cloud/email_and_collaborative_solutions/) .

### View another Zimbra email address <a name="modify-settings"></a>

The Zimbra app only allows you to configure one email address at a time. For this reason, you will need to log out of the email account you are currently using, in order to view another Zimbra email account.

Go to the menu `☰`{.action}in the upper left corner of your screen, then select the profile icon at the top of your screen. Finally, press `Disconnect`.

### What if a blank screen appears when I launch the application?

This is a network connectivity load fault. We recommend waiting a few moments for the application to finish attempting to connect.

If nothing happens, check that your mobile network connectivity is correct, then close the application completely and restart it. Repeat as necessary.

If the problem persists, reinstall the application. This will reset the settings and eliminate potential corruption in the application configuration file.
